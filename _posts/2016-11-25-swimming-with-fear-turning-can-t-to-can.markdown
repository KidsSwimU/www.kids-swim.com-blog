There are certain ways in which swimming is like any other sport: It's roughly 80% mental and 20% physical.

There are also certain ways in which swimming is different from most other sports.  These differences mean that a special approach to addressing the fear of water (or, more correctly, the fear of drowning that gets in the way of learning how to swim) is required.

WHERE MOST INSTRUCTORS GO WRONG

Many swim instructors have been swimming most of their lives.  It usually means they have had more opportunities to practice moving around water than the average person, which also usually means their water skills and abilities are more well-honed than the average person.  This is a good thing.  One would hardly trust someone to effectively teach something they can't execute or model.

The potential downside to this is that most of them can't remember what it was like to learn how to swim or to fear water.  Maybe they have never feared water.  Thus, their ability to empathize with students who fear water may be minimal.  What the instructor feels is important to prioritize may not be in alignment with their students' priorities.  In any relationship, when the parties involved are not on the same page, forward progress can be difficult.
